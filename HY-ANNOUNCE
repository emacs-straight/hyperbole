Subject: GNU Hyperbole 7.0.1-7.0.2 is now available
Date: Wed, 23 Nov 2017
--text follows this line--
This is a minor release with a number of small issues resolved and the following
new features:

  SMART (ACTION AND ASSIST) KEYS

    - Keyboard Drags: Keyboard emulation of many Smart Mouse Key drag actions.
      See "(hyperbole)Keyboard Drags".
  
    - Keyboard Help: When {M-o} is bound to the `hkey-operate' command to
      emulate drag depress and release events, then when in the release window
      prior to pressing the second {M-o}, {C-h A} now reports the drag
      action associated with the current release point.  See "(hyperbole)C-h A".

    - Ace Window: Integrated Hyperbole item drag and link creation with this
      package's direct window selection.  Use {M-o i <window-id>}.
      You typically can display any Dired or Buffer Menu item in any window
      with a single 3 keystroke command!

      Also added the ability to 'throw' an item to a window while leaving the
      selected window the same.  Use {M-o t <window-id>}.  This
      works in Dired, Buffer Menu, iBuffer Menu and Treemacs modes and lets
      you throw multiple items to multiple windows quickly.

      See "(hyperbole)Keyboard Drags" for setup and use instructions.

    - Smart Treemacs: Smart Key and item drag support for the Treemacs package.
      See "(hyperbole)Smart Key - Treemacs".

  HYROLO

    - Fixed Google Contacts support to prompt for authorization only during
      first time use.

GNU Hyperbole (pronounced Ga-new Hi-per-bo-lee), or just Hyperbole,
is an amazing, programmable hypertextual information management
system implemented as a GNU Emacs package and extensively
documented.  Hyperbole has been greatly expanded and updated for
use with the latest Emacs 26 releases; it supports GNU Emacs 24.4
or above.

Hyperbole can boost your day-to-day productivity with Emacs and
your ability to manage information stored across many different
machines on the internet.  People who get used to Hyperbole often
find they prefer never to use Emacs without it.

Hyperbole includes its own easy-to-use hypertextual buttons and
links that can be created without the need for any markup language.

It also comes out-of-the-box with:

  - a hierarchical, record-based contact manager

  - a rapid window and frame control system

  - a powerful multi-level auto-numbered outliner

  - and two very smart context-dependent mouse and keyboard keys
    that simplify operations in many editing and browsing modes.
    All features are aimed at making textual information management
    and display fast and easy.

Bob Weiner designed and programmed GNU Hyperbole.  He and Mats
Lidell maintain it with the Free Software Foundation.  It includes
an interactive demo to introduce you to its features as well as a
detailed reference manual, as explained here:

Please give Hyperbole a try.  It's free, man.  It adapts to your
needs. It connects everything.  It rewires your brain.  It speeds
your web searches for `carpal tunnel syndrome'.  It makes you feel
like the sun is out on a gray winter day :-)

But wait, there's more and this part is serious.  For a limited
time, to encourage use and feedback, the first 30 people who try
out the Hyperbole DEMO or read the Hyperbole Manual and send a few
thoughtful sentences to <rsw at gnu dot org> will receive either of
their choice of the following as yet unpublished single file Emacs
Lisp libraries:

;;  rsw-linecol.el: User-editable mode-line col/line number formats
;;
;;  GNU Emacs buries the formatting of mode-line line and column
;;  numbers in a way that makes it virtually impossible for a user
;;  to change this formatting.  This library fixes that with a new
;;  variable which may be modified to instantly alter the mode-line
;;  column and line number display.

or

;;  rsw-chrome-macos.el: Open a URL in Google Chrome and reuse an
;;     existing tab/window if already displayed.
;;
;;  This library resolves the many problems of sending URLs to
;;  Google Chrome on MacOS.  It properly sends # hash in-file links
;;  (these are typically stripped when Chrome is called as a MacOS
;;  application).  It reuses any tab already displaying any
;;  matching URL that is sent and it does this even if the
;;  ultimately displayed URL goes through several redirects before
;;  display.

Enjoy,

Bob Weiner and Mats Lidell
