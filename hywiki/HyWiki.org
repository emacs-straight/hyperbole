* HyWiki

This is Hyperbole's markup-free personal wiki system for note-taking
and automatic wiki word highlighting and hyperlinking.  It uses Org
mode for note taking and adds automatic hyperlinking of HyWikiWords
within Org files in `hywiki-directory' (default = "~/hywiki"), where
a HyWikiWord is a capitalized word that contains upper and lowercase
letters only and has a corresponding HyWikiWord.org wiki page file
below `hywiki-directory'.  HyWikiWords require no delimiters.

* HyWikiWords

HyWikiWords are also recognized in text buffers after the global
minor mode, `hywiki-mode' is enabled via {M-x hywiki-mode RET}.  To
create or jump to a HyWiki page, simply type out a potential
HyWikiWord or move point onto one and press the Action Key {M-RET}.
This will create the associated page if it does not exist.  This
also highlights any other instances of HyWikiWords across all
visible Emacs windows.  HyWiki is built for scalability and has been
tested to be performant with 10,000 HyWikiWords.

Once Hyperbole has been loaded and activated, HyWikiWords (with or
without delimiters) are automatically highlighted and active in
the following contexts:
  - HyWiki page buffers;
  - non-special text buffers, when `hywiki-mode' is enabled;
  - comments of programming buffers, when `hywiki-mode' is enabled.

As HyWikiWords are typed, highlighting occurs after a trailing
whitespace or punctuation character is added, or when an opening
or closing parenthesis or curly brace is added to surround the
HyWikiWord.  Since Org links use double square brackets and Org
targets use double or triple angle brackets, HyWikiWords within
these delimiters are ignored.

* Org-style HyWiki Links

You can also create Org links to HyWikiWords in any non-special text
buffer by surrounding them with double square brackets and the
'hy:' prefix, as in: [[hy:MyWikiWord]].  If you set
`hywiki-org-link-type-required' to `nil', then you don't need the
prefix, e.g. [[MyWikiWord]]; existing HyWiki page names then will
override Org's standard handling of such links.  To prevent Org
mode's binding of {M-RET} from splitting lines and creating new
headlines when on a HyWiki word whose page has not yet been
created, set `hsys-org-enable-smart-keys' to `t' so that
Hyperbole's Action Key does the right thing in this context.

* HyWiki Settings

The custom setting, 'hywiki-word-highlight-flag' (default = 't'),
means HyWikiWords will be auto-highlighted within HyWiki pages.
Outside of such pages, 'hywiki-mode' must also be enabled for such
auto-highlighting.

The custom setting, 'hywiki-exclude-major-modes' (default = 'nil'), is
a list of major modes to exclude from HyWikiWord auto-highlighting and
recognition.

Within programming modes, HyWikiWords are highlighted and hyperlinked
within comments only.  For programming modes in which you want
HyWikiWords recognized everywhere, add them to the custom setting,
'hywiki-highlight-all-in-prog-modes' (default =
''(lisp-interaction-mode)').

* hywiki-word Implicit Button Type

HyWiki adds one implicit button type to Hyperbole: 'hywiki-word',
which creates and displays HyWikiWord pages.  This is one of the lowest
priority implicit button types so that it triggers only when other types
are not recognized first.
